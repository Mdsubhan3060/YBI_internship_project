# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts customer churn in a bank using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). By identifying customers likely to leave, the bank can take proactive steps to retain them and reduce revenue loss.

## Project Outline
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and encoded customer data (e.g., CreditScore, Balance, Age).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed features to find patterns in customer behavior.

Modeling: Built predictive models using Logistic Regression and SVM.

Evaluation: Compared models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Results

Both models showed reliable performance in predicting churn. Key performance metrics include:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy = X%

SVM: Accuracy = Y%

# Future Improvements

Consider testing additional algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and exploring deep learning for enhanced accuracy.
